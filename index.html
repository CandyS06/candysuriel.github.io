            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Candy Suriel, an islander from the Dominican Republic now navigating life in the United States. </p>
            <p>My journey into the world of travel began during a university exchange program in Brazil, where I embraced the challenge of living independently in a vast country and immersing myself in a language that was new to me (although it was super similar). </p>
            <p>This experience ignited my passion for exploration and cultural exchange, teaching me resilience and adaptability.</p>
